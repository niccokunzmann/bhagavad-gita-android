As both armies stand ready for the battle, the mighty warrior Arjuna, on observing the warriors on both sides becomes overwhelmed with grief and compassion due to the fear of losing his relatives and friends and the consequent sins attributed to killing his own relatives. So, he surrenders to Lord Krishna, seeking a solution. Thus, follows the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita.
